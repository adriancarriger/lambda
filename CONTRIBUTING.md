Lambda is a reference implementation — the ideas are meant to be taken and adapted, not maintained as a shared project.

That said, issues and pull requests are welcome. Bug reports, documentation improvements, and experience reports are especially useful. Feature PRs will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
